# school-shooting-data-viz

**Pentaho data integration** was employed to analyze school shooting data in the United States. The process began with a 200-row CSV file, which was used to create multiple schemas, including star schemas, to identify dimensions, facts, and measures. A **Dimensional Fact Model (DFM)** was developed, and a small 5-table data warehouse was built based on it. Analyses were performed on the data, such as identifying relationships between features and building a story. Built **3 dashboards** with **4 charts** each were built using **Tableau** for data visualization.
